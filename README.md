# product-cost-optimization-analysis
This repository contains the code and analysis for the "Cost Optimization and Analysis in Product Supply Chain" project. The goal of this project is to analyze and optimize product-related costs, focusing on manufacturing and shipping expenses across different product categories.
Key Features:

Data Exploration: Detailed exploration and cleaning of the dataset, including handling missing values and outliers.
Cost Analysis: Calculation of key cost metrics and visualization of cost distribution across product types.
Advanced Analytics: Potential integration of predictive modeling to forecast costs and identify cost-saving opportunities.
Visualization: Utilization of Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for clear and insightful data visualizations.
